        Original implementation from https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore/blob/master/fvcore/nn/focal_loss.py .
        Loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.

        Args:
            inputs: A float tensor of arbitrary shape.
                    The predictions for each example.
            targets: A float tensor with the same shape as inputs. Stores the binary
                    classification label for each element in inputs
                    (0 for the negative class and 1 for the positive class).
            alpha: (optional) Weighting factor in range (0,1), In practice it may be set by inverse class frequency
                    or treated as a hyperparameter to set by cross validation. Default = None, for ignore
            gamma: Exponent of the modulating factor (1 - p_t) to
                balance easy vs hard examples.
            reduction: 'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'
                    'none': No reduction will be applied to the output.
                    'mean': The output will be averaged.
                    'sum': The output will be summed.
        Returns:
            Loss tensor with the reduction option applied.
